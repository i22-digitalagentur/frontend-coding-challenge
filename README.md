# Frontend Coding Challenge
This is a coding challenge for frontend developers applying at i22.

## Scenario
Howdy! In this coding challenge we kindly ask you to create your own nice dynamic developer profile. Please use the [Github GraphQL API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql, the explorer at https://developer.github.com/v4/explorer/ might help a lot) and your own Github Account credentials. Use a *famous github profile* (e.g. `gaearon`) for demonstration purpose or feel free to use your own account if it's not empty. Then display:

1. avatar and bio
2. the total amount of repositories
3. the name and amount of stars of the last 15 repositories ordered by most stars
4. paginate those repositories and display only 4 repositories per page
5. Add a select to change the order from stars to creation date
6. Add a new score that is calculated by the amount of forks per stars

To achieve this you are free to use Vue, React, Web Components (even Stencil) or just vanilla JavaScript. Whatever you decide for you should pay attention to your code organization and style. You will present this repository to some of your potential new buddies afterwards. Also we would like to be able to show this repository to anybody else without having to explain anything, so please provide appropriate documentation.

## Mission
- [ ] Fork this repository
- [ ] Write concise commit messages
- [ ] Submit a merge request and describe your changes precisely

## Please note
- The tech stack is your own decision.
- Don't just prepare the happy path, also think about possible error sources.
- Pay attention to your code style and structure.
- Display well in Google Chrome, don't waste time on other browsers.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, feel free to use any framework.
- Don't pay special attention to responsive design.
- If you don't have enough time for everything, focus on a part of it rather than doing everything just okayish.
